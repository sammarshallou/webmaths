Overview
--------

This project is a collection of Web services that can be run in a Java
application server to provide mathematical equation processing features.

We have a filter (not yet publicly released) for the Moodle virtual learning
environment platform which uses these services so that users can view equations
as images in a user-selected size and colour, or directly to the browser as
MathML if they have a supported browser, regardless of whether the equations
were initially entered as TeX or MathML.

The latest version of this system uses the MathJax.node project (server-side
MathJax) to render equations. At present it also includes older methods, but
we may phase these out.


Services
--------

The service names all begin with WebMaths. They are:

Tex:       Converts a subset of AMS LaTeX to MathML 2.
           Converts the same subset back from MathML 2 to AMS LaTeX.
           (The subset is documented in misc/supported.tex.commands.xml.)

English:   Converts MathML 2 into English text suitable for using as 'alt' text.
           Warning: The results of this service are presently not very good.

Image:     Renders MathML 2 using the JEuclid library. Size and colour can
           be selected.

ImageTex:  For MathML that was originally converted from TeX using the above
           converter, renders it using latex and dvipng software. For other
           MathML, uses JEuclid as above.

MathJax:   Uses MathJax.node backend to render both TeX and MathML. Can convert
           multiple equations at once and can provide SVG as well as PNG format
           files.

           The MjEnglish, MjTex, and MjImage servlets are implementations of the
           above contracts using this MathJax backend.


Image and ImageTex are plug-in compatible (they use the same WSDL, so you can
use a different one by changing the URL in your service client). ImageTeX can
produce prettier images, but requires 'latex' and 'dvipng' to be installed on
the server. Image is pure Java; it requires no extra installation, and also
performs better, but the images can be a bit ugly.

MathJax and the Mj* servlets requires MathJax.node to be installed in the
server; the default location is /opt/mathjax_node, or you can configure it
(see web.xml).

Basic build/setup instructions for testing
------------------------------------------

1) Run the ant build script with the 'wsdlgen' target. This will create the
   'gen' folder based on the WSDL files.
   -> In Eclipse, right-click build.xml and choose 'Run as > Ant build...',
      then select the wsdlgen target and deselect others.

2) If you want your IDE to compile the project:
   a) Refresh the project if necessary to see the 'gen' folder.
      -> In Eclipse, right-click the project root and choose Refresh. 
   b) Add the 'gen' and 'test' folders to your IDE's source path. (The 'src'
      folder has probably been included by default, but if not, add that too.)
      You can also add 'analysis' if you like.
      -> In Eclipse, right-click the folder and choose Build path /
         Use as source folder.
   c) Add all the library .jar files in 'lib' to the IDE's build path.
      -> In Eclipse, right-click and choose Build path / Add to build path.

3) You can now run some of the services locally on the built-in Java 6+ test
   server by running uk.ac.open.lts.webmaths.DevServer 
   -> In Eclipse, right-click this file and choose Run as / Java application.

4) You can also run unit tests by running JUnit on the 'test' folder.
   -> In Eclipse, right-click this folder and choose Run as / JUnit test. 

5) To build the web application to a running Tomcat, run the ant script with the
   'tomcatdeploy' target. You will need to set the variables tomcat-url,
   tomcat-username and tomcat-password. The specified username needs to have
   the manager-script role (note that the default admin user in Tomcat doesn't).

6) To build the web application as a .war file, run ant script with the 'war'
   target. You can set the Ant property war.location to the folder where you
   want to put the .war file.

7) Once you have installed the application, you can test it is running by going
   to its root URL. This will take you to a status page.


How to write clients
--------------------

To get the JAX-WS information page for any service once you have installed it
on your server, go to http://your.server.example.com/webmaths/ and follow the
'Web services' link - you'll get a list of all eight services together with the
WSDL files that should be all you need in order to write software that uses the
services. The WSDL files contain documentation for all parameters and return
values. 

The WSDL files are WS-I compliant so should be usable from all programming
languages.

If you are writing new software and can install node.js and MathJax.node on
the server, I would recommend using only the 'mathjax' service. The other
services may be phased out eventually.
